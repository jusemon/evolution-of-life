## Gameplay

The game begins with the player controlling a single-celled organism in a primordial soup. The player must navigate through the environment, avoiding predators and finding sources of nutrition to grow and reproduce. As the organism grows and develops, it gains new abilities and adaptations that help it survive in different environments. Each level represents a different era in the evolution of life on Earth, from the early single-celled organisms to the emergence of complex organisms such as reptiles and mammals. The player must navigate through each level, adapting to the changing environments and competing with other organisms for resources. Along the way, the player can collect DNA points, which can be used to unlock new adaptations and abilities to help the organism survive and thrive.

## Art Style

The art style of the game is inspired by scientific illustrations of prehistoric creatures, with a focus on accuracy and detail. The game will feature hand-drawn graphics with a muted color palette to evoke a sense of the past.
